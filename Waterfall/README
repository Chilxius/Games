This is probably the best game I've made so far.
You are a ninja climbing up a waterfall to kill some giant octopus monsters.
The game includes powerups, difficulty settings, and increasing levels of difficulty as you progress.
It also has a full endgame screen that isn't just a GOOD JORB screen.
To my knowledge, there are no outstanding glitches.

I did make this game a while back, before I was comfortable with Processing and before I had relearned the coding tricks I used to know.
The game would benefit from many changes, the least of which being the use of classes. But it works so I think I'm done with it.
Could use sounds, though.
