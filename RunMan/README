This is a platformer where you run as long as you can while collecting powerups to keep you alive.
The flying eyeball creatures are taken from my Waterfall game.
The chomper will catch you eventually because its speed is based on the amount of time the game has been running. If you've played SkiFree, this should be familiar.
