This is the first real game I made in Processing.
It's a game where your avatar follows the mouse cursor and you have to avoid the chasers.
I made this back when I was learning Processing so the code aint the greatest.
Once caught, clicking the mouse resets the game, but not perfectly. The game becomes glitchier with every subsequent restart.
There are hidden "cheats" activated by pressing certain buttons.
